# fist - the future of of politcal movements
We aim to be the one-stop-shop for anyone wanting to get invovled in social justice movements either online or in person.

# We don't sell data
Fist is a completly non-profit and doesn't sell your data. Our only goal is to help the people get more invovled in their local politcal atmosphere

# We're unbiased 
Our algorithm doesn't favor one protest over another, and allows members of diffrent poltical ideolgies to orgainze.

# We're safe
Every protest is reviewed by human moderates before it posted, so that any hate-oriented and/or non-peaceful demonstration is weeded out, allowing our users to ensure that what ever protest they attend is safe.

# We're completely free
Altough donations are happily accepted, every single one of app's features are completely free to use. 

# We're user-friendly
We have worked hard to ensure that our product is as efficent and easy-to-use as can be, with mutiple language support and even more accessibility features on the way.
